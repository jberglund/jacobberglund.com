I suppose an introduction is in order. I'm Jacob and I have been building web things for over a decade now. About five years ago I started doing mainly web app development (read: React) and as such, my career as a maker of consumer facing website came to a natural stop. Instead of mainly juggling CMSes I was trying to make React behave nicely with D3. A learning curve, to be sure. Not D3, but React. I'll admit: I did not like class components. A bit too much boilerplate for my taste. Then, enter Functional Component. My Javascript knowledge went from passable to proefficient. Life was good.

### Modern CSS features present on this site

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  html {
    scroll-behavior: smooth;
  }
}
```

Explainer: So smooth scrolling has been done with JS for quite some time.
