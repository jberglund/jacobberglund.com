I suppose an introduction is in order. I'm Jacob and I have been building
web things for over a decade now. About five years ago I started doing mainly
web app development (read: React) and as such, my career as a maker of consumer
facing website came to a natural stop. Instead of mainly juggling CMSes I was
trying to make React behave nicely with D3. A learning curve, to be sure. Not
D3, but React. I'll admit: I did not like class components. A bit too much
boilerplate for my taste. Then, enter Functional Component. My Javascript
knowledge went from passable to proefficient. Life was good.

### Modern CSS features present on this site

Please excuse the profanity â€” I fucking love the web. And let me tell you, 2023 is a damn good year for web development.
I get ahead of myself. Why is it better? Several reasons, in fact:

- Browsers auto updates and users tend to let them do it.
- The Web Platform Tests https://web-platform-tests.org/intro-video-transcript.html
- The Interop initiave, which started in 2022 and now https://wpt.fyi/interop-2023

### Interop

You noticed that we vendor prefixes stopped being a thing? Vendor prefixes gave browsers a way to push forward, but it also introduced divergence, Before Interop and The Web Platform Tests we were reliant on browser vendors agreeing to do the same thing.
I remember thinking "oh, nice, hehe, see you in 4 years".
Well, whaddayaknow Cascade Layers sits at 93.19% https://caniuse.com/css-cascade-layers
"One of the big new web-platform features in 2022 was Cascade Layers".

In summary, the Web Platform Tests project has had a positive impact on the development of web browsers by promoting interoperability, consistency, and a collaborative approach to implementing and evolving web standards. It has become a crucial tool in the web development ecosystem, contributing to a more stable and predictable web platform.

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  html {
    scroll-behavior: smooth;
  }
}
```

Explainer: So smooth scrolling has been done with JS for quite some time.
